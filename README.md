# Overview

This project is a To-Do List Web Application designed to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, Dom manipulation, and web interactivity. The app allows users to add, categorize, complete, and delete tasks in an organized layout. Each task can be assigned to a category: work, study, or personal, and marked as complete with a simple checkmark toggle.

The main purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with JavaScript event handling, dynamic element creation, and responsive front-end design.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual tudio Code as my main development environment because it provides powerful features such as live server preview, syntax highlighting, and easy integration with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle dynamic interactions and logic. I also used Google Fonts to enhance the visual design and modern DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript to manage tasks, categories, and user actions in real time.
